## Boxing with Friends 
Andoird App that lets you enjoy a professional Boxing match remotely against your friends while OpenCV 3.0  (a computer vision library) utilizes your camera to combine photography and augmented reality to capture, manipulate and track opponent’s face in real-time.


### How the branchs will be set up:


### Whats its composed of?
1. OpenCV (a computer vision library)
2. Android SDK (a mobile app framework)
3. OpenGL ES (a 3D graphics framework)
4. JNI (a Java/C++ interoperability layer)

*You don’t have to know this but it might help:*

1. Some simple high school math and Physics
2. General physics concepts and notation
3. Measurable quantities
4. physical quantities
5. Scientific notation
6. Expressing the values of physical quantities
7. Motion, what causes it and how to describe and analyze motion essential formulas will be included or you can just google it
8. Dynamics is the study of force and motion. By specifying the forces acting on object, you can compute its motion. Again google will have most of the formulas which will be plugged into the SDK
